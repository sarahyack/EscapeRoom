# EscapeRoom
### A Text-Based Puzzle Game
<hr/>

##### Description:
A text-based game where you try to solve the puzzles in a sequence of rooms to reach the end.

##### Development:
Currently very early in development, with just the basics of classes and commands implemented although not at all optimized. Currently events are activated by keyword-like commands such as "pick up __item__", "use __item__", etc.  

Future plans for this include optimizing command structure and user experience as well as working on adding more rooms and their corresponding puzzles.
